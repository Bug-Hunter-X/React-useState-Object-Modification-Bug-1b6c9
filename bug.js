This bug occurs when using the `useState` hook in React with an object as the initial state. If you try to update the state by directly modifying the object, React won't re-render the component because the object reference hasn't changed.  This is because JavaScript objects are passed by reference.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [myObject, setMyObject] = useState({ count: 0 });

  const incrementCount = () => {
    myObject.count++; // This does not trigger a re-render
    setMyObject(myObject); // This also won't work as expected
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {myObject.count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
